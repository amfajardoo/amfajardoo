# 👋 Hi there, I'm Andres!

### 🌟 Frontend Developer | Angular, NgRx, & NestJS Enthusiast

A passionate Developer with a focus on building robust, scalable, and maintainable applications. I specialize in the modern **JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem**, leveraging the power of Angular for dynamic frontends and NestJS for enterprise-grade backends.

---

## 🛠️ My Core Technology Stack

I thrive in the world of structured and reactive development. Here's a look at the technologies I use most frequently:

### 🌐 Frontend (The Angular Ecosystem)
* **Angular:** Deep expertise in crafting modern Single Page Applications (SPAs), focusing on component-based architecture and performance optimization.
* **NgRx (State Management):** Experienced in implementing complex state management following the Redux pattern (Actions, Reducers, Selectors, Effects) to ensure predictable and scalable application flow.
* **RxJS:** Proficient in using reactive programming principles to handle asynchronous data streams and complex user interactions.
* **TypeScript:** Writing strongly-typed, clean, and maintainable frontend code.

### ⚙️ Backend (The NestJS Powerhouse)
* **NestJS:** Building efficient and scalable server-side applications using this progressive Node.js framework. I follow its modular and architectural patterns (Controllers, Providers, Modules, Guards, Interceptors).
* **Databases:** [PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
* **ORMs/ODMs:** [TypeORM, Prisma, Mongoose]
* **Testing:** [Jest] for reliable backend services.
